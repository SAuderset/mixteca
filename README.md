# Exploring Mixtecan language history
## A collection of materials of Mixtecan languages and tools to explore them

This repository is in its initial stages and thus a bit chaotic as of now. Everything's in flux and more info will be provided later on. 
It is managed by me (Sandra Auderset), as part of my PhD thesis. Feel free to ask me about any of this.
