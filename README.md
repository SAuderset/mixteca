# Exploring Mixtecan language history
## A collection of materials of Mixtecan languages and tools to explore them

Hi! 
This repository is in its initial stages and thus a bit chaotic as of now. Everything's in flux and more info will be provided later on. 
It is managed by me (Sandra Auderset), as part of my PhD thesis. Feel free to ask me about any of this.


### Comparative List
a list of 207 concepts for which I will collect entries from as many Mixtecan languages as possible
will be used for subgrouping

### Digitalization
some dictionaries and other works that I digitized (OCR and text extraction)

### Lex Lists
the word lists that formed the basis of my comparative list

### MetaInfo
contains language codes and bibliographical information

### Orthography Profiles
a mapping of graphemes to IPA for each variety

### Tools
small tools I use to do annoying things faster

### Verbs
collection of materials I will use to build a comparative Mixtecan verb database
