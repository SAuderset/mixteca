# Meta Info on Languages, Communities, and Materials


### Annotated Mixtecan Bibliography
based on Glottolog, contains bibliographical information on Mixtecan materials
annotated also for the following:
* languages under discussion (for codes see below)
* whether tone marking is provided or not (TONE)
* type of material (DOCTYPE)
* what material I plan to collect from the source

### Sources by language
derived from the annotated bibliography, but presented by language (instead of by source)


### Mixtecan Concordance
The list provides the following:
* a unique identifier for each variety (per village) - note that I add these on a 'as needed' basis
* village name plus alternative spellings/names
* branch membership within Mixtecan
* municipality and state
* coordinates
* ISOcode, Glottocode, further info from Glottolog (if available)
* classification by Josserand 1983, INALI, Egland 1978 (if available)
